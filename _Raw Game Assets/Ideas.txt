[ I love it because I had lots of fun in it and because I met lots of people that I became friends with... Because it was a world I felt like I belonged to, another world where I live. ]
Monstrus, BloodXWings or something, Helena, Lady, Tessa, Monkey, Caror, Duck, Kessy, Artur, Dramingard, Black Barbie, fin, Vee (Veni), must (musthundu), many more and even those I can't remember.
I had fun doing quests, I read them too. I had fun doing dungeons with people too and achieving things (getting more powerful, gear, new skills, learning new dungeons,...). I love that amazing and relaxing background music along with the nature theme of various locations.


The places looks will change, even if just for the individual, as he saves that place.

All NPCs are nameless unless they tell you their name.

There are a lot of NPCs that are not quest givers. People shopping, working, kids playing, men in the tavern/bar,...

Seasons, weather, day and night

Mermaids that seduce men near the dock (on the shore, made of wood) drag them down and feed off their souls

"I'm not really fond with the game anymore...so much has changed to "help" the players..so many handouts it just feels...I'm not sure how to describe it. It used to be a great feat to get to level 100+, nowadays people may have multiple 100+ charas. I'm not sure when exactly it happened, but to me Perfect World International lost something very important and special along their journey and I don't think they'll ever get it back. They'll just continue to cheapen the game into the ground."
